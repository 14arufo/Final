    <p> Hi everyone, my name's Alex. I am 22 years old, filipino man who is currently resides in San Jose, California. I am 2D/Manga artist.
     I am currently attending Ohlone community college to get my graphic design degree which is art degree that is essential to becoming 2D/manga artist.
     Becoming manga or comic artist has been my lifetime dream. I always wanted to become mangaka(as manga or comic artist). 
    </p>
    <p class="left"> I am new artist that is coming into art industry and manga industry soon. I will be working as freelancer mangaka or comic artist after I graduate Ohlone college with graphic design degree. 
     After Ohlone college, I will be transferring to any university that provides bacholor degree in minor comic studies. After university, I will now have graphic design degree and minor comic studies in BA. Here is my portfolio, that shows my expertise in making 2D art and manga.  
        </p>
